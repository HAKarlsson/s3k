/**

 * This header file contains the declarations for the ticket lock
 * synchronization primitive, which allows multiple threads to acquire
 * a lock in a fair and orderly manner. The ticket lock works by assigning
 * each thread a unique ticket number, and then serving threads in the order
 * of their ticket numbers. This ensures that threads acquire the lock in
 * the order that they request it, preventing starvation and ensuring
 * fairness.
